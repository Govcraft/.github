# Hey, I'm Roland 👋

Govcraft is just me—a one-person shop. I'm an entrepreneur and open-source developer with over 30 years in software architecture and engineering. I live and work on a sailboat with my family and 3 cats, running everything on solar power while cruising the Pacific.

## What's Govcraft?

It's where I build and maintain open-source tools that I think are useful. No giant company here, no investors, no unlimited resources—just me trying to make good software and share it with the world.

## Current Projects

- **[acton-service](https://github.com/Govcraft/acton-service)** - Production-grade Rust microservice framework with enforced best practices
- **[acton-reactive](https://github.com/Govcraft/acton-reactive)** - Actor-based reactive framework for Rust
- **[rust-docs-mcp-server](https://github.com/Govcraft/rust-docs-mcp-server)** - MCP server for querying Rust crate documentation

## Support My Work

If you find any of this stuff useful, consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/Govcraft). Your support helps me keep the lights on (literally—boat batteries aren't cheap) and lets me spend more time building and maintaining these projects for everyone.
